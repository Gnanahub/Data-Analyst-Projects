Welcome to the Data Analytics Project Repository
This repository contains a collection of data analytics projects, from basic to advanced, organized by sector and industry. The projects are designed to help you learn the basics of data analysis, as well as apply your skills to real-world problems.

The projects are divided into the following categories:

• Basic: These projects are designed for beginners who are new to data analysis. They cover topics such as data cleaning, data wrangling, and data visualization.

• Intermediate: These projects are designed for those who have some experience with data analysis. They cover topics such as statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.

• Advanced: These projects are designed for experienced data analysts. They cover topics such as natural language processing, time series analysis, and predictive modeling.

In addition to the projects, the repository also includes a README file that provides instructions on how to install and use the projects. There is also a forum/Link where you can ask questions and get help from other data analysts.

We hope you find this repository helpful in your learning journey.
